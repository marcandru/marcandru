- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcandru
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Visions, Web Developtment and Game Developtment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, I'd like to make web apps with rust.
- I'm thinking of using this repo for uploading files that'd I like to have for my laptop and desktop,
  like my shell configs.
